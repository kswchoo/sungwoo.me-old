Hi!

Long time no see. How are you?

Meantime, my homepage was showing a boring resume-like page.
Once I've decided to renew here, I am going to put some 'blog'. It is hardly necessary to say that my first blog was opened 10 years ago.

During a decade, I've been tried many blogging tools such as [TatterTools(TextCube)](http://www.textcube.org/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) and also tried to use service type blogging tool such as [Tistory](http://www.tistory.com/), but finally I shut down blog. There was several reasons, but main reason was the social feature are moved on to Facebook or Twitter. Also, I realized that digital footage on Internet can be burden to me.

Without blog, suddenly I felt I am losing chances to explain something honest and deep way. Maybe, especially in social network, every topics are just light as feather so we are forgetting ability to give weight to stories.

Whatever, let's keep in touch!
